> The **magic spell** is only an opcode that is one or multi hex for a command. The magic spell is also the _**ISA**_ (**Instruction Set Architecture**) for the linker.

# Opcode Hex length.
The length of a hex op begin with `1` and end with `FF`.
The reserved range begins from `1` to `F`.
```
0x00 0x01 0x02 0x03 0x04 0x05 0x06 0x07 0x08 0x09 0x0A 0x0B 0x0C 0x0D 0x0E 0x0F
```

The length `0x01` is only necessary for a section. With `0x02` and above must in the file define. Only the `0x01` mustn't define. It is defaulted.

# Opcodes with one hex.

## Comment
The magic spell is `0x98`
The magic spell for the comment is the length as hex from the comment in hex.

If the length hex is bigger than 255, the hex is beginning with the magic spell `0xA1` and then the length of the hex from the length of the comment.

```
0x98 0xA1 0x02 0x01 0x28 ...
```
A comment with the length of 296

> // Hello World

```
0x98 0x0b 0x48 0x65 0x6c 0x6c 0x6f 0x20 0x57 0x6f 0x72 0x6c 0x64
```

```

```
0x98 0xA1 0x03 0xAC 0x23 0x37 ... (Comment with length of 0xAC2337)
```

# Header

The header defines all necessary information for the linker.

### The first section of the header defines itself with `48` hex.

```

```

### In the second section of the header define itself it with `32` hex.
```
0x00 0x01 0x02 0x03 0x04 0x05 0x06 0x07 0x08 0x09 0x0A 0x0B 0x0C 0x0D 0x0E 0x0F

```

If an OS doesn't support the file, the DOS or Unix replace with 0x00 by the own length. The DOS replace by `0x00 0x00 0x00` and unix by `0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00`.
**If no of both is support, the linker doesn't work.**

### In the third section of the header defines itself with unlimited hex. Here comes all information about the file itself.

The _**first**_ hex defines the length of the length of the hex for the length of the name of the file.

The _**second**_ hex defines the length of the name of the file. The length is the length of the hex.

```
0x00 0x01 0x02 0x03 0x04 0x05 0x06 0x07 0x08 0x09 0x0A 0x0B 0x0C 0x0D 0x0E 0x0F

```

The .start section must be at the end of the header if all information is in the header.

If no name is included or exist, the file's name is automatically `Nemo` with the length of `4` hex.

After the `.start` section the linker start to execute the hex and create an executable file. The **body** proceed.


> CAOFS in the hex means Cosmo Advance Object File System

# Object and Var
## Unsigned

`0xAA` for Var in hex with only one hex 0x00 (0–255).
After the value of the one hex the {0x len(var -1)} varname in hex

```
0xAA 0x87 0x01 0x48
```
A var with `1` as value and `H` as name

For value bigger then one hex 0x00
0xAB then {0x len(value -1)} hex full length

```
0xAB 0x03 0x01 0x02 0x03 0x01 0x48

=>

0xAB 0x03 (0x01 0x02 0x03) 0x01 0x48
```

A var with `66051` as value and `H` as name

By signed value the hex is `0xAC` and for the over 8 bit are `0xAD`
```
0xAC 0x87 0x0b 0x48 0x65 0x6c 0x6c 0x6f 0x20 0x57 0x6f 0x72 0x6c 0x64
```

A var with the value `-11` and `Hello World` as name

```

```

A var with the value `-AF0B` and `Hello World` as name

# Section

To call a section the spell is `0x01 0x37`

`.text` is with the hex `0x00 0x00 0x00` for show the linker now a new section begins and then the magic spell `0x93 0x12 0xAB 0x3A 0xFF`.

`.data` the magic spell `0x93 0xFB 0xAC 0xA8 0xDF`.

`.section` the magic spell `0xAB 0xFF 0x29 0x10 0xAC`.

- in the `.section` a section can be created. The length of the name of the section is the length of the hex. If the hex is over 255 the hex `0xA1` and then the length of the hex for the length. The name of the section is the hex of the name of the section.

```
0x01 0x37 0xAB 0xFF 0x29 0x10 0xAC 0x01 0x48
```
A section with the name `H` is created.

For over 255
```
0x01 0x37 0xAb 0xFF 0x29 0x10 0xAC 0xA1 0x02 0x01 0x48 ...
```
A section with a name with the length of 296 is created.

With goto the magic spell is `0x93 0x12 0xAB 0x3A 0xFF` and then the name of the section in hex. WIth the same property of the length of the section.

The length is the length of the hex of the name of the section. If the length of the hex is over 255 the hex `0xA1` and then the length of the hex for the length.

```
0x01 0x37 0x93 0x12 0xAB 0x3A 0xFF 0x01 0x48
```
goto the section with the name `H`.

For over 255
```
0x01 0x37 0x93 0x12 0xAB 0x3A 0xFF 0xA1 0x02 0x01 0x48 ...
```
goto the section with a name with the length of 296.

After the header: `.start` the magic spell `0x28 0xFF 0x88 0xAC 0x37`

Must be at the end of the file: eof
`.end` the magic spell `0x27 0xAB 0x3A 0xFF 0xAC`
